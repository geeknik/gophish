Gophish
=======

Gophish is an open-source phishing toolkit. It provides the ability to quickly and easily setup and execute phishing engagements and security awareness training.

### Building From Source
**You are building from source whether you like it or not, please note that Gophish requires Go v1.10 or above!**

Simply run ```git clone https://github.com/geeknik/gophish.git``` and ```cd``` into the project source directory. Then, run ```go build```. After this, you should have a binary called ```gophish``` in the current directory.

### Setup
After running the Gophish binary, open an Internet browser to https://localhost:3333 and login with the default username and password listed in the log output.
e.g.
```
time="2020-07-29T01:24:08Z" level=info msg="Please login with the username admin and the password 4304d5255378177d"
```
