# Security Policy
## Reporting a Vulnerability
Thank you for taking the time to find and report a security vulnerability in this project.

## Disclosure Policy
Open a public issue. Full disclosure only.

If you discover a vulnerability, report it by opening a public GitHub issue with complete details. This project follows a full-disclosure model.

## Important Guidelines
You should NOT expose code you DID NOT AUDIT yourself to the Internet. Running unaudited code in production environments and then claiming "vulnerabilities" invalidates any legitimate security findings. If you haven't personally reviewed the codebase and understood its security model, you have no standing to report issues.

Don't be that guy who deploys random code to sensitive environments and then complains about the consequences.
